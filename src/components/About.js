      <h1>A little about me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Web Developer living and operating from Manchester(UK), I'm also
        currently studying through Manchester University in Full Stack
        Development. I'm enjoy building fullstack, front and backend projects
        that solve issues that we all have, the only thing more satisfying than
        fixing a problem, is fixing a problem with code. I love tackling
        problems head on and enjoy creating intriguing solutions to those problems
        with the technologies I know and even further learning new technologies
        to tackles those new issues.
